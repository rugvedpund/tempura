### Tool for Efficient coMPUtation of mode-coupling estimatoR normAlization (TEMPURA)

This package contains a python module to compute analytic normalization of quadratic estimators for lensing, cosmic birefringence, patchy tau and point sources, based on separable formula. 

The code was verified in the following stiduies:

  - **Lensing Reconstruction, Delensing** \
   Namikawa & Nagata JCAP 09 (2014) 009, https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6568
  - **Cosmic Birefringence** \
   Namikawa et al. PRD 101 (2020) 083527, https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10465
  - **Patchy Reionization** \
   Namikawa PRD, 97 (2018) 063505, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00058


### Installation

  Run 

    python setup.py build_ext -i
  
  You can then 'import tempura' if this repository is in your PYTHONPATH.

  We are working on making this package available on PyPI (for a pip install).


### Examples

You can find the example codes at "test" directory.
